Hiâ€¼ My name's [mikasaid](https://twitter.com/dzakysaragih), and I've gradually mutated over the last decade into being super obsessed with open source, backwards compatibility, and finding ways to balance what I feel are ethical obligations to *all* users of projects I interact with, with the very real problem of time management, burnout, and work/life balance.

I've been a part of TC39 (the committee that writes the specification for JavaScript) since 2014, and I was an editor of the specification from 2018-2021. I've been heavily involved in the node community for as many years, and I've gradually created (but mostly inherited or been gifted) a decent number of open source projects. I persist in trying to maintain them all with maximal back compat, the strictest adherence to semver, and the greatest respect for users.

## Projects I Maintain
